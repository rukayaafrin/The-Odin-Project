## What are arrays useful for?

- efficiently access items by their index

## How do you access an array element?
- index

## How do you change an array element?
`myArray[index] = newValue`

## What are some useful array properties?
- `length`


## What are some useful array methods?
- `push()`: add one or more elements to the end of an array

- terminates the current loop
-

## What is the **continue** statement?
- skips the current iteration of the loop
- moves execution to the next iteration of the loop

## What is the advantage of writing automated tests?
- catch bugs early in the development process
- ensure code behaves as expected
- make refactoring easier
- documentation
- catch bugs after refactoring
